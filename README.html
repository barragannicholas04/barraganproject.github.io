Portfolio for Nicholas Barragan

Hello! My name is Nicholas Barragan and I am originally from Illinois where I earned my Associates in Engineering Science at Moraine Valley Community College. I am currently enrolled at Iowa State University where I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Cyber Security Engineering. I recently switched my major from Computer Engineering because I like the opportunities and the general field provided with Cyber Security. I currently have no side projects that I am working on, but the last two semesters I have had one. One was a coding website where users would learn how to code from reading and then testing their knowledge on a small test. My latest project was entered into the Illinois SkyWay STEM Competition and won seconds place. It was a drone that had the capability to identify what people were in the area based on Student ID's and Bluetooth. I do have a few plans I wished to bring to reality but I am still getting accustomed to my recent move away from my family.
